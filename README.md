# Credit-Risk-analysis
### Overview of Project
#### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyse data generated from a small population who have recently (2019) taken out loans. This data includes 9 variables taken from 1000 individuals, varying from checking / savings amount, job type, age, gender, and more. The goal of this project is to analyze the populations that typically need the most credit. Furthermore, additional analyses were completed to better understand other relationships that may exist within the data. This analysis may shed light onto finicial discrepancies between populations and identify populations that most often seek credit. 

#### Analysis
Before completing any analyses, the data was first investigated. After understanding the data in the dataset, preliminary analysese were done regarding gender differences in age, sum of credit withdrawn, jobs, and more. Furthermore, distributions of credit amount by savings and checking account amount were generated. Lastly, correlations between age / credit amount, credit amount / duration, and credit amount / job type were identified by linear regression.

#### Results
The people that tend to need the most credit are males below 40. This population tends to have skilled or highly skilled career categories. The most common reason for needing credit is for a radio / TV, followed by education and furniture / equipment. There is a strong postive correlation between credit amount and duration of credit, as well as between credit amount and career category.
